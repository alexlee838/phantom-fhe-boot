# PhantomFHE (Modified Fork)

This is a modified fork of [PhantomFHE](https://github.com/encryptorion-lab/phantom-fhe), an open-source library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with native GPU acceleration. This fork includes custom changes to support additional functionality and improvements.

ðŸ“˜ **Project Note**: This repository was developed as part of an undergraduate graduation project (2025) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University.

## ðŸ”§ Modifications

This fork introduces the following enhancements over the original PhantomFHE:

- **CKKS Bootstrapping Support**  
  Integrated support for bootstrapping in the CKKS scheme.  
  *Implementation adapted from OpenFHE.*

- **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) Kernels**  
  Added neural network inference kernels, including Convolution, Softmax, Relu, Average Pooling, Fully Connected Layer, designed for encrypted inference.  
  *Based on concepts from:  
  "Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning With Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Deep Neural Network"  
  by Joon-Woo Lee, Hyungchul Kang, Jieun Eom, Maxim Deryabin, Yongwoo Lee, Woosuk Choi, Eunsang Lee, Junghyun Lee (Graduate Student Member, IEEE),  
  Donghoon Yoo, Young-Sik Kim (Member, IEEE), and Jong-Seon No (Fellow, IEEE).
